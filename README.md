# TIC-TAC-TOE
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI(Random class) opponent in Java.

Getting Started:

Prerequisites: Java Development Kit (JDK) 11+
Download: Clone the repository or download the code files.
Running: Compile the code using javac TicTacToe.java and run java TicTacToe to play.

Gameplay:

X plays first and alternates turns with the AI.
Enter your move by row and column number (e.g., 1,2).
Try to score three in a row before the AI wins!

Features:

Minimax algorithm for intelligent AI opponent.
Difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard).
Track win/loss records.

Structure:

TicTacToe.java: Main class with game logic and AI.

Future Plans:

Implement additional AI algorithms.
Enhance user interface with graphics.
Expand to larger grid sizes.
